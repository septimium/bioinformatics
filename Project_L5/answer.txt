The main issue with our algorithm is that it's fundamentally broken by sequence repeats. 
The only reason it appears to work correctly right now is because We've 'cheated' by commenting out the second half of the original DNA, which was a massive repeat. 
If we were to run this algorithm on the full, 1470-character sequence, it would fail. 
Our 'greedy' logic of just 'finding the longest overlap' isn't smart enough; it would see the end of the first repeat and the end of the second repeat, think they're the same thing, and 'collapse' the two repeats into one. 
We'd end up with an assembly of only ~735 characters, proving our algorithm can't tell the two identical paths apart.
